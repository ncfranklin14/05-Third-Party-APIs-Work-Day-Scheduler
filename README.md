# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

* For this homework I used JQuery, HTML, and CSS to create a workday scheduler. By doing this project I was able to practice using a whole variety of "tools in my toolbox" including: using bootstrap, moment, funtions and much more. It was a good project to pull all my skills together and build something I could actually use! 

## Usage

Add important events to the daily planner and help user manage their time effectively.
